Title: How AI Saved the Day: Reconciling Massive CSV Files with a Bash Script

As developers, we often face daunting tasks that demand both precision and speed. Recently, I encountered one such challenge: reconciling two massive CSV files, each with 1.5 million records, 128 columns, and a whopping 1.5GB in size. My goal was to ensure the columns in both files matched perfectly. What started as a tedious problem turned into a showcase of AI’s potential, thanks to GitHub Copilot. Here’s how AI helped me solve this problem efficiently—and why you should consider using AI in your own workflow.

The Challenge: Reconciling Huge CSV Files

The task was straightforward but intimidating: verify that two CSV files had identical column structures (headers and data types) and identify any discrepancies. With 1.5 million rows and 128 columns, manual inspection was out of the question, and even traditional coding approaches felt daunting. I needed a solution that was fast, reliable, and scalable.
Initially, I considered writing a script myself in Python or Java—languages I’m comfortable with. But given the size of the files, I worried about performance and the time it would take to code and debug. That’s when I turned to GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, to see if it could help.

The Journey: From Python to Java to… Bash?

I started by asking Copilot to generate a Python script to compare the CSV files. The first attempt produced a script that used pandas to load the files and compare headers. While functional for smaller datasets, it struggled with memory usage due to the sheer size of the files. Loading 1.5GB CSVs into memory was a non-starter.
Next, I asked Copilot for a Java solution, hoping for better performance. The Java code used streaming to process the files line by line, which was more memory-efficient, but it was still slower than I wanted and required significant boilerplate code.
Frustrated but curious, I decided to push Copilot further. I asked for a solution that was “fast, lightweight, and optimized for large files.” To my surprise, Copilot suggested a Bash script using command-line tools like head, cut, and diff. I was skeptical—could a simple Bash script handle such a massive task? But I gave it a shot, and the result was nothing short of spectacular.

The Winning Solution: A Lightning-Fast Bash Script

Here’s a simplified version of the Bash script Copilot generated:
bash

This script:

Extracts the headers from both CSV files using head.

Compares headers with diff to identify discrepancies.

Counts columns by splitting the header row on commas.

Outputs results and cleans up temporary files.

The script was blazing fast—completing the comparison in seconds, even on 1.5GB files. By leveraging lightweight Unix tools, it avoided the memory overhead of Python’s pandas or Java’s file parsing. I was amazed at how such a simple solution could outperform my initial expectations.

Why AI Made the Difference

This experience highlighted several reasons why AI tools like Copilot are game-changers for developers:
Speed of Development: Copilot generated the Bash script in minutes, saving me hours of research and coding.

Creative Problem-Solving: I wouldn’t have considered a Bash script without Copilot’s suggestion. AI expanded my perspective on possible solutions.

Iterative Refinement: When Python and Java didn’t meet my needs, Copilot adapted quickly, offering a completely different approach.

Performance Optimization: The Bash script was not only fast to write but also optimized for the task, leveraging the right tools for the job.

Promoting AI Among Colleagues

To my fellow developers: if you’re not using AI tools like Copilot yet, you’re missing out. These tools don’t replace your expertise—they amplify it. Here’s why I encourage you to give AI a try:
Tackle Complex Problems: AI can suggest solutions for tasks you might not know how to approach.

Save Time: Let AI handle boilerplate code or propose optimizations so you can focus on higher-level design.

Learn New Techniques: AI exposed me to a Bash-based approach I hadn’t considered, expanding my skill set.

Boost Confidence: Even if the AI’s first suggestion isn’t perfect, iterating with it is faster than starting from scratch.

Tips for Using AI Effectively

To get the most out of AI tools like Copilot:
Be Specific: Clearly describe your requirements (e.g., “fast, lightweight, for large files”).

Iterate: If the first solution isn’t ideal, refine your prompt or ask for an alternative approach.

Verify Output: Always test and validate AI-generated code, especially for critical tasks.

Experiment: Don’t be afraid to ask for solutions in unfamiliar languages or paradigms—you might be surprised!

Conclusion


Reconciling two 1.5GB CSV files was a daunting task, but AI turned it into a triumph. GitHub Copilot not only saved me time but also delivered a solution that was faster and more elegant than I could have imagined. This experience solidified my belief in AI as a powerful ally for developers. I encourage all of you to explore AI tools in your own projects—you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve.
Ready to give AI a try? Start with a small task, experiment with tools like Copilot, and see how they can transform your workflow. Let’s embrace AI and build better, faster, and smarter together!


Prompt

I am a developer and need to write a blog post explaining how I had a need to reconcile 2 huge csv files ( 1.5m records and 128 columns, about 1.5gb in size). For this I asked AI ( copilot) to create a reconcilliation program to check the columns match. Afdter a copul of attempts ( one in python and one in java) it created a fantastic bash script that worked and run really quickly. The point of hte post is to showcase th euse of AI and promte AI usage amonst my colleagues
